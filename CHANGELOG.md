# MxScout - Release Notes

## MxScout 1.1.2  (November 7, 2026)
- Camera Survey (Help menu) now collects everything needed for the coming Camera Settings and Camera Logs windows: the camera's full configuration, every settings section with its labels and choices, and its log/information pages. Read-only - it never changes anything on the camera - and passwords are shown as ***.

## MxScout 1.1.1  (November 7, 2026)
- FIXED: on screens with Windows display scaling (125%, 150%...) the camera picture was drawn too big, cutting off the camera's own text along the edges (name and date at the top, VM/REC status at the bottom). The whole picture now shows.
- The camera-name bar now sits ABOVE the picture instead of over it, so it never hides the camera's own text.

## MxScout 1.1.0  (November 7, 2026)
- NEW: Automatic updates. MxScout checks for a new version when it starts and every 6 hours. When one is ready, a yellow bar appears at the top: click "Update now" and MxScout downloads it, checks it's genuine (size, checksum and version), swaps itself and restarts - your cameras, layouts and settings stay exactly as they were.
- NEW: Help > Check for Updates Now, and Help > What's New (this list).
- You can switch automatic checking off in Settings > Start-up (takes effect immediately).

## MxScout 1.0.1  (November 7, 2026)
- FIXED: boxes and text overlapping on laptops running Windows display scaling at 125%, 150% or 200%. Every window, list column, icon and gap now grows with your display setting.
- FASTER: camera pictures are shrunk to tile size in the background, so the window stays quick with many cameras.
- The navigator panel remembers its width correctly at any display scaling.

## MxScout 1.0.0  (November 7, 2026)
- First release: a video management program for MOBOTIX cameras, laid out like MxControlCenter.
- Scan for Cameras: pick your network(s); cameras appear with status dot, name, IP, MAC, model, firmware, and whether MxScout already knows them; live preview once the password is set; add to Video Sources or straight into a new layout.
- Layouts tree with folders, Video Sources list, drag-and-drop onto the grid, Auto grid or fixed grids, yellow frame on the active camera, full screen, snapshots.
- Live video that automatically uses less network on big grids.
- Playback straight from the cameras' file-server (SMB/CIFS) recordings: all cameras in sync on one timeline, reverse, fast-forward up to 128x, frame-by-frame, instant replay.
- Export to MP4 (YouTube, email, phones) or the original MOBOTIX .MXG evidence copy.
